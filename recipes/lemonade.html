    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Lemonade is a timeless and refreshing beverage that embodies the essence of summer with its vibrant citrus flavor and thirst-quenching properties.

The beverage is typically served over ice, allowing the flavors to meld together while providing a cool respite from the heat. Each sip offers a burst of citrusy goodness, awakening the taste buds with its bright and invigorating taste. Whether enjoyed on a hot day at a picnic, by the poolside, or simply as a delightful treat at any time of year, lemonade is a classic beverage cherished for its simplicity and refreshing appeal.</p>
